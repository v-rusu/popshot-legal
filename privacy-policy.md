---

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect and process only the minimum data necessary to operate and improve Popshot.

| Category | Type of Data | Purpose | Storage / Retention |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| **User Photos & Edits** | Images uploaded for editing or remixing, prompts, style metadata | To perform AI-powered image editing and remixing features | Temporarily stored on secure cloud servers during processing, then deleted within 90 days of subscription expiry |
| **Device & App Information** | App version, device model, operating system, usage statistics | To maintain and improve app performance | Anonymous / aggregated |
| **Analytics Data** | Firebase Analytics, Apple App Store Analytics | To understand usage patterns and improve user experience | Aggregated, anonymized |
| **Crash Data** | Firebase Crashlytics error logs | To identify and fix app crashes or bugs | Anonymized logs retained for diagnostic purposes |
| **Purchase Identifiers** | RevenueCat-generated user ID | To manage in-app purchases and restore subscriptions | Retained for as long as necessary to manage billing and purchase history |

### Face Data (Landmarks & Masks)

**Face Data (Landmarks & Masks)**: During editing, Popshot may compute non-identifying facial landmarks and segmentation masks from user-provided photos to locate the face region (e.g., boundaries, keypoints) and apply edits precisely. Popshot does not collect or store biometric identifiers or "faceprints," and does not perform facial recognition or identity verification. These derived data are ephemeral and are not retained after processing is complete.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Data

We use collected data to:

1. Provide and operate Popshot‚Äôs editing and remixing features.  
2. Process images in the cloud using AI systems.  
3. Maintain app performance, detect crashes, and resolve bugs.  
4. Analyze aggregate usage trends through analytics tools.  
5. Handle in-app purchases and restore entitlements through RevenueCat.

We **do not sell, rent, or share personal data** with any third party for advertising or marketing purposes.

### Face-aware Editing & Alignment

We use ephemeral facial landmarks and segmentation masks solely to: (i) apply edits limited to the face region (e.g., lighting, exposure, red-eye, skin retouch), (ii) generate subject-aware masks for background/scene changes and style remixes, and (iii) align templates/styles while preserving natural facial features. These data are not used for identification, authentication, advertising, profiling, or model training.

---

## 4. Cloud Processing

Popshot uses secure cloud-based servers to perform AI processing of images.  
Images and related metadata may be **temporarily stored** during processing and are automatically deleted after the operation completes or within **90 days** after a user‚Äôs subscription becomes inactive.

All transfers are encrypted in transit and at rest.

### Face Data Handling

Popshot performs AI processing on secure cloud infrastructure. Facial landmarks and segmentation masks exist only in memory during processing and are discarded immediately after the operation completes. User photos may be temporarily stored on encrypted cloud storage solely to deliver the requested edit. All transfers and storage are encrypted in transit and at rest.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- Uploaded content: deleted within **90 days** after subscription expiry.  
- Crash and analytics data: retained as aggregate, non-identifiable statistics.  
- Purchase and transaction records: retained for accounting and legal compliance as required by applicable law.

### Face Data

Facial landmarks and segmentation masks are not retained after processing (typically seconds to minutes). User photos are stored only as needed for processing and are deleted in accordance with this Policy, including within 90 days after a subscription becomes inactive.

---

## 6. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

| Purpose | Legal Basis |
|----------|--------------|
| Providing the App‚Äôs functionality | **Performance of a contract** (Art. 6(1)(b)) |
| Crash and analytics diagnostics | **Legitimate interest** (Art. 6(1)(f)) |
| Purchase management | **Performance of a contract** (Art. 6(1)(b)) |
| Data retention for compliance | **Legal obligation** (Art. 6(1)(c)) |

---

## 7. Data Sharing and Transfers

We may share limited technical data with trusted service providers solely to operate the App:

| Partner | Purpose | Data Shared |

| **Firebase (Google LLC)** | Analytics and crash diagnostics | Usage statistics, crash logs |
| **RevenueCat** | Subscription and purchase management | Anonymous user ID, transaction info |

All third-party providers comply with GDPR and process data under Data Processing Agreements (DPAs).

### Face Data

Popshot does not sell or share face data (landmarks, masks) with third parties for advertising or marketing. Limited processing by cloud service providers occurs under data processing agreements strictly to operate the App's features. Face data is not persisted by these providers beyond processing.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Where data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on lawful transfer mechanisms such as **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** or equivalent safeguards.
